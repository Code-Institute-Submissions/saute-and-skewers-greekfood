# Saute & Skewers | Greek Food 

## Aim

To create a fun interactive front end website that responds accordingly to the users actions. This website is designed so users can create their 'Perfect Date' by selecting specified dropdown criteria and clicking the button. The outcome will reveal their chosen perfect date.

Technologies to be used in the project are HTML/CSS/Javascript with optional framework and API.

## Purpose

The owner of Destination Date Night wants to create a fun website that allows users to interact using differing functionality. The user will select specified criteria from the two dropdowns then click a button, this will in turn produce an outcome. The user can review this outcome in order to make a decision on where to go on their date.

It is hoped that the users will find the website to be a fun and interesting way to gather ideas for a date. By using the search criteria offered and the results the site returns the user can plan a date that will suit their individual needs.

## UX

## User stories

### Site Owner

The owner would like users of the website to - 

-  Interact with the site to find their perfect date.

-  Enjoy the site and use it as a useful tool to find ideas.

-  Find the site is fun and simple to use.



The owner would like the website design - 

- To be sultry looking with colors and a theme that portrays this.

- To have a hero image that creates mystery and excitment.

- To be one page with two easy to navigate sections. Section 1 - The Dating Game and Section 2 - Create A Date.

- To have a navigation bar that links to the sections when clicked.

The site will -

1. Have three main sections, the first a hero image with text enticing the user to look further, the second will be a querky narrative explaining the site, the third will house the interactivity.
2. Explain the websites outcome by instructing how it is to be used.
3. Based on criteria selected, output a 'date' which will be in text form. Also the Google Maps JS API will host static markers where the user, based on their criteria selection can click on the specific 'City' marker where the date location and direct link to the website will be. 
4. Link to external social media sites.
5. Will have contact details - location and email address of Destination Date Night HQ.

## 5 Planes

### Strategy

- Saute & Skewers..... is currently a simple fun interactive website. It allows simple usage to provide a fun factor for idea gathering. It features the 3 core languages of web development HTML, CSS and Javascript and Google Maps JS API as a prime feature. 

- There is a clear brand (although no logo as of yet) and a company philosophy of "Making Memories" whilst incorporating this the fun factor was required to be a major part of the content.

- Saute & Skewers..... has the potential of not only being a popular fun idea gathering site for current users, it potentially has the power to become a thriving business site. By adding a few addtional features to the site and marketing it well, Destination Date night could be something with a decent ROI.

- During research I was unable to find any other sites that had the same 'making memories' concept within a simple game like page making Destination Date Night a niche. 


### Scope 

- The site was developed with simplicity in mind. It was scoped to provide a straight forward approach, the user was to click a few dropdowns and a button and the site would produce an outcome. The Google Map JS API was to be the prime feature.


### Structure

- Saute & Skewers site structure was to hold pages that where relevant and required. 

- The site has X areas, Navbar, Hero Image, 2 main sections with descriptive text and interactivity and a footer. It is hoped the user would be drawn into the site with by the brand design, color, image and text.


### Skeleton

#### Wireframes

Wireframes where created for all pages of the site.

Desktop and Mobile wireframes were created to demonstrate xxxxxxxxx. 

They were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/).

### Surface 

Colors and fonts where important to the website to promote a xxxxx, tempting, feel good reaction.
The site's "xxxxx" colors of blues and whites where chosen to enhance this feeling.

### Future Features

Saute & Skewers - Future features could include:

## Defensive Design

## Testing
### Features:

Testing was undertaken during the creation of this site, manual testing included tests on various devices. W3C Markup Validator, validation check was ongoing throughout the project development.
Pep8 compliance ......

Below highlights the main issues and bugs found during the development.


#### Issue 1

#### 

#### Issue 9

Validation sites
- When validating the code for HTML and CSS errors where found and rectified. Mostly simple errors and typos.
- JShint for JS validation found there where xxx warnings, however many was of the same error. Unfortunately a fix wasnt implemented due to lack of understanding on how to resolve them and to time constraints. 
  Here are the errors 
  - **
  
### Defensive Design

- 


### Browsers tested

- Chrome: Using Google Developer Tools - Chrome was used for testing on Laptop, Tablet and Android devices.

- Safari: Safari wasn't used for testing on an I phone or Mac, due to not having access to these type of devices.

### Devices tested

On final testing session the below devices where used here are the outcomes.

Mobile:
- Android - Samsung Galaxy A40 - Outcome: Site works perfectly. No bugs found. All is responsive.
- Android - Samsung Galaxy A20 - Outcome: Site works perfectly. No bugs found. All is responsive.
- Android - Samsung Galaxy S10 - Outcome: Site works perfectly. No bugs found. All is responsive.

Laptop:
- Toshiba Satellite C850 - Outcome: Site works perfectly. No bugs found. All is responsive. 


## Evaluation

- The owner is pleased with the design and development of this site. It has all the basic requirements of a functional website and meets the project criteria.
- The site definitely has room for future interactive activity, functionality and imagery.
- During later stages of development it was realised some of the testing should have been branched off to show the workings. Something the owner will keep in mind for next time.
- All testing was manual, the use of the Jasmine framework was not used. Again something to consider in the future, especially if additional functionalities are added at a later stage.
- In User Stories in 'the site will' section it was stated - *Also the Google Maps JS API will host static markers where the user, based on their criteria selection can click on the specific 'City' marker where the date location and direct link to the website will be.* However this idea and functionality was not applied, primarily due to not having a full understanding of its concept and due to time contraints. 
  It wasnt feasible to add the marker functionality to the site just so it had something that was interactive when the developer wasn't confident in their abilities to be able to explain the workings and possibly only having one marker that worked. Therefore it was decided to develop the site with only one static marker on the map that pre sat on opening and when hovered over on a laptop popped up text.
  Once the developer has a better understanding in place this feature will be the first to be added. Being able to click the marker of the date location and it provide at minimum the name of the date location and a link to it was one of the prime functionalities during inception.
- In Potential Client section, it was stated the user could *contact Destination Date Night with questions (via a contact form direct from site)*, a form wasnt implemented again due to time constraints. A workaround was thought about and tested by way of an alert box - as explained in Testing section - Issue 7. When this feature is implemented EmailJS is a possible tool to use.
- It was found during the last stages of building this site that there was actually a site slightly like Destination Date Night. It was found when adding the final destination criteria to the site. The owner was disheartened and discouraged on the finding after the hard work and thought put into designing this site.
