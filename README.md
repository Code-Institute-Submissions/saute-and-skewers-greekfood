## Introduction

With visitors from all over the world Greece is notably a favourite destination to all tourists. One of Greece's well known highlights is by far it's food.

From street food to quality cuisine and finally Mama's homecooked treats, the Greek have a wide variety of superb delights to offer.

This site allows the owner(admin) user to showcase their best loved recipes and hopes to gain traffic in the form of registered users to form a fantastic database of user favourites.


<hr>


### Aim

To create a functional website that allows users to manipulate data using the CRUD functionality.

Prime technologies to be used in the project are HTML/CSS/Javascript/Python/Flask and MongoDB.

### Purpose

Saute & Skewers is a Greek food website where users can view recipes stored in the sites database, however registered users can also manipulate their own data using the create, read, update and delete - CRUD functionality.

It is hoped that all users to the site will find the website to be of interest and of use. Registered users have the added benefit of actively being part of a community.

## The 5 Planes of content strategy

### Strategy

- Saute & Skewers is a functional website. It allows simple usage to provide a great way to add and share content. 

- It features the 3 core languages of web development HTML, CSS and Javascript, as well as Python and Flask. It is deployed to a MongoDB database. 

- There is a clear brand that draws users and entices interactions.

- Users who discover Saute & Skewers, easily grasps it's concept - how it works and what it's output is.

- Saute & Skewers has the potential of not only being a content sharing site, it could potentially become a business site. Adding a few addtional features and marketing the site well could mean Saute & Skewers could generate revenues.

- During research there where other sites found that had the same concept, although the Greek aspect was minimal. 


### Scope 

- The site was developed with the intention of allowing users to build a database of their own recipes.

- The database of choice to build with was NoSQL - MongoDB.

- It was scoped to provide ease of use.

- Have the CRUD functonality.

- House a home page, registration page, log in page, log out page.

- Be responsive on all devices.

- Be visually appealing that incorporated Greek culture in the front-end design.


### Structure

- Saute & Skewers site structure was created from the UX user stories - therefore developed with pages that where required to enable users to sign up and add data.

- All pages are designed identically with 3 sections - a Navbar, content area and a footer.

- The Home page has a main image and 'Welcome' text. 
- The Highlights page shows a selection of recipe content and images for all users to view.
- The Register page has a basic registration form with a button and a link to login if already registered.
- The Login page has a basic login form with a button and a link to register if not already a member. 
- Once logged in the Login page becomes a Profile page, this shows a 'Welcome back' text, a few enticing words and a link to the 'Add Recipe' Page
- The Add Recipe page is where users add their own recipes once they submit the recipe it takes them to the Recipes page.
- The Recipes page is the home of user recipes already added. This is data stored in the database.
- Finally the Log out page displays, a 'You have been logged out message' and the same Log in view.

### Skeleton

Wireframes where created with only the main pages of the site in mind. Therefore only four where initially created.

These Desktop and Mobile wireframes demonstrate the basic design and structure of the site and the required elements each page needed. 

All wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/).


Desktop:

[Home](wireframes/base-desktop.png)
[Register](wireframes/register-desktop.png)
[Login](wireframes/login-desktop.png)
[Recipes](wireframes/recipes-desktop.png)


Mobile:

[Home](wireframes/base-mobile.png)
[Register](wireframes/register-mobile.png)
[Login](wireframes/login-mobile.png)
[Recipes](wireframes/recipes-mobile.png)



### Surface 

Front-end visuals where based on:
 - A great brand design.
 - Traditional Greek colours.
 - Powerful images.
 - Enlighting text in which it is anticipated that the user would feel positive and maybe daydream to another world.

Colours and fonts therefore where important to promote traditional greek culture, with a tempting, feel good reaction.
With the Greek flag and its symbolic colours of blue and white, the sites aim was to incorporate this into its design. 

Users will see that Saute & Skewers chose a simplistic design with ample whitespace to provide an instant attraction on site opening.

## Defensive Design

*Defensive design is the practice of planning for contingencies in the design stage of a project or undertaking. Essentially, it is the practice of anticipating all possible ways that an end-user could misuse a device, and designing the device so as to make such misuse impossible, or to minimize the negative consequences.*
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_design/)

......................

### Testing

Testing was undertaken during the creation of this site, manual testing included tests on various devices. W3C Markup Validator, validation check was ongoing throughout the project development.
Pep8 compliance ......

Below highlights the main issues and bugs found during the development.


#### Issue 1

Initial routing wasnt correct, data was coming through to recipes.html as id forgotton the index.html

#### Issue 2



#### Issue 3

Needed more pages adding to site to allow for guest user and session user interaction

#### Issue 4

Materialize Carousel wasnt loading wellm the links kept breaking

#### Issue 5

#### Issue 6


Validation sites
- When validating the code for HTML and CSS errors where found and rectified. Mostly simple errors and typos.
- JShint for JS validation found there where xxx warnings, however many was of the same error. Unfortunately a fix wasnt implemented due to lack of understanding on how to resolve them and to time constraints. 
  Here are the errors 
  - **
  

### Browsers tested

- Chrome: Using Google Developer Tools - Chrome was used for testing on Laptop, Tablet and Android devices.

- Safari: Safari wasn't used for testing on an I phone or Mac, due to not having physical access to these type of devices. However they were viewed on Google Dev Tools.

### Devices tested

On final testing session the below devices where used here are the outcomes.

Mobile:
- Android - Samsung Galaxy A40 - Outcome: Site works perfectly. No bugs found. All is responsive.
- Android - Samsung Galaxy A20 - Outcome: Site works perfectly. No bugs found. All is responsive.
- Android - Samsung Galaxy S10 - Outcome: Site works perfectly. No bugs found. All is responsive.

Laptop:

## Evaluation

- Overall the design and development of this site is ................. It has all the basic requirements of a functional website and meets the project criteria.
- Most of the user stories where met, with the exception of .... editing user content.. probabably better to just delete or block user..............
- Many future features could be added to provide more interactive activity, functionality and imagery.
- Branch testing - No branch testing was undertaken....
- Manual Testing was undertaken .....Werkzeug ..........................more testing was required..
- Some front-end design changes where made during the build due to varying factors:
    - Materialize image carousel, looked good but didnt load well. Also the developer found it difficult to change the prebuilt images and the links kept breaking.
    - The site was to have 4 pages initally but it was discovered early in development that more pages would be required.

## Deployment

#### Heroku:

The project is deployed to Heroku. It uses the automatic deployment method via Github, using your Github repository.
Below shows the steps to deploy on Heroku:

1. Heroku requires certain dependencies and applications to run our application. There we need to tell it whats required. 
   In the terminal type 
   - $ pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
   - $ echo web: python app.py > Procfile
2. Register on the Heroku website - [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) or Log in for existing users.
3. From the dashboard click 'New' and 'Create new app'.
4. Enter your unique 'App name' (Heroku practice is for it to be lowercase and to use hyphen (-) instead of spaces).
5. Select your region, then click 'Create App'.
6. Create app directs to Heroku's 'Deploy' tab, select the deployment method of 'GitHub'.
7. Your Github profile should be displayed, enter your repository name here and click 'Search'. (Idealy your Heroku app name and your repository name should be the same).
8. Your repository should display here and a 'Connect' button appears to connect to your app.
9. Before you click 'Connect', head over to 'Settings' tab and scroll down to the 'Config Vars' section. As we have contained our Environment Variables
   in our env.py file we need to tell Heroku these in a secure manner.
   Add your variables to the below Key/Value pairs:
    - IP
    - PORT
    - SECRET_KEY
    - MONGO_URI
    - MONGO_DBNAME

10. Final step before we connect to Heroku is to push our new files 'requirements.txt' and 'Procfile' to the repository.
    Back in the terminal have a check of the workspace status, type: git status. this will show your new pending files.
    Continue in the terminal and type:
    - $ git add requirements.txt
    - $ git commit -m "Added requirements.txt"
 
   - $ git add Procfile
   - $ git commit -m "Added Procfile"

   - $ git push

11. Go back to Heroku 'Deploy' tab, click 'Enable Automatic Deploys' in the section Automatic Deploys. Finally under Manual Deploy section click 'Deploy Branch'.
    Heroku will now receive the code from GitHub and start building the app using the required packages.
    Once built you will receive the message 'Your app was successfully deployed' then can click 'View' to launch your new app.

12. Your deployed app is now available and should update automatically everytime you push to the Github repository.



#### Github:

In [GitHub](https://github.com/) we can view the repository. 

Should you want to 'Fork' or 'Clone' this repository to use as a base template for your own projects you can do so.
 - To 'Fork':
1. Head to the repository, on the top right click 'fork' button.
   You now have your own copy of the forked repository in your Github account.

If you want to run this project locally, we must clone the project.
- To 'Clone':
1. Under the repository name, click the 'Code' button on the right.
2. A dropdown 'Clone with HTTPs' section appears, here copy the clone URL for the repository.
3. In your local IDE open Git Bash.
4. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type 'git clone' and paste the URL you copied.

- Example: git clone  = https://YOURNAME.github.io/saute-and-skewers-greekfood/

6. Press Enter. Your local clone is now created.
