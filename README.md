## The 5 Planes of content strategy

### Strategy

- Saute & Skewers is a functional website. It allows simple usage to provide a great way to add and share content. 

- It features the 3 core languages of web development HTML, CSS and Javascript, as well as Python, Flask and connects to a MongoDB in order to do this. 

- There is a clear brand that draws users and entices interactions.

- Users who discover Saute & Skewers, easily grasps its concept - how it works and what it's output is.

- Saute & Skewers has the potential of not only being a content sharing site, it could potentially become a business site. Adding a few addtional features and marketing the site, Saute & Skewers could generate revenues.

- During research there where other sites found that had the same concept, although the Greek aspect was minimal. 


### Scope 

- The site was developed with the intention of allowing users to build a database of their own recipes.

- It was scoped to provide a registration page ...........................


### Structure

- Saute & Skewers site structure was created from the UX user stories - therefore holding pages that where required to enable users to sign up and add data.

The site has 4 pages:
- All pages are designed identically with 3 sectons - a Navbar, content area and a footer.

- the Home page houses a carousel of images and 'Welcome' text. 
- the Recipes page shows recipe content and images for all users.
- the Register page has an enticing message, registration form with a button and a link to login if already registered.
- the Login page also holds 'Welcome back' text, a login form with a button and a link to register.


### Skeleton

Wireframes where created for all pages of the site.

Desktop and Mobile wireframes were created to demonstrate the basic design and structure of the site and the required elements each page needed. 

All wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/).


Desktop:

[Base](wireframes/base-desktop.png)
[Register](wireframes/register-desktop.png)
[Login](wireframes/login-desktop.png)
[Recipes](wireframes/recipes-desktop.png)


Mobile:

[Register](wireframes/register-mobile.png)
[Login](wireframes/login-mobile.png)
[Recipes](wireframes/recipes-mobile.png)



### Surface 

With a great brand design, traditional Greek color, images and positive text it is anticipated that the user would feel positive and maybe daydream to another world.

Therefore colours and fonts where important to promote a traditional, tempting, feel good reaction.
The site's "sea and sky" colors of blues and "authentic clean building" whites where chosen to enhance this feeling.

Users will see that Saute & Skewers is aiming for a affluent look. The carousel images and the simplistic design provides that instant attraction on site opening.

*Defensive design is the practice of planning for contingencies in the design stage of a project or undertaking. Essentially, it is the practice of anticipating all possible ways that an end-user could misuse a device, and designing the device so as to make such misuse impossible, or to minimize the negative consequences.*
